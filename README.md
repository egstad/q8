# Q8

> VIA keymap settings for my Keychron Q8 mechanical keyboard

# Overview

Looks like Keychron isn't too keen on publishing a modifiable layout map to QMK's repo... I know. Shit.

But whatever, we'll use VIA and have to miss out on some of the best features (like auto-shift!).

There are a few gotchas to keep in mind with modifying the Q8 with VIA. For starters, let's talk about layers.

## Layers

There are 5 predefined layers on the Q8, which are organized quite poorly IMHO.

| Layer | Default                 | Function        |
| ----- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| 0     | Mac system              | Mac layer 1     |
| 1     | Window system           | Windows layer 1 |
| 2     | Mac multimedia Keys     | Mac layer 2     |
| 3     | Windows multimedia keys | Windows layer 2 |
| 4     | Function layer          | Function layer  |

To toggle between Mac and Windows, just flip the binary toggle next to the USB. Slick.
